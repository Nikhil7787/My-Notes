map Function: Explain how map applies a function to all items in an input list and returns a new list with the results. </br>
filter Function: Teach filter for selecting elements from an iterable based on a function condition. </br>
reduce Function: Introduce reduce from the functools module for applying a function to the elements of an iterable to reduce them to a single value.
