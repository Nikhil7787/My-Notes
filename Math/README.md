#  Mathematics 

## ✅ Arithmetic

Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. </br>
### Example:

```
a = 10
b = 5
addition_result = a + b  # 10 + 5 = 15
subtraction_result = a - b  # 10 - 5 = 5
multiplication_result = a * b  # 10 * 5 = 50
division_result = a / b  # 10 / 5 = 2.0
```


## ✅ Algebra
It forms the basis for solving problems, designing algorithms, and manipulating data structures. </br>
### Example: </br>
1. Variables </br>
variables are symbols (usually letters) that represent unknown or changing values. In programming, variables serve a similar purpose. They are used to store and manipulate data.
```
x = 5  # x is a variable storing the value 5
y = x + 3  # y is a variable storing the result of an operation involving x

```
2. Expressions and Operators </br>
Expressions are combinations of variables, constants, and operators that represent a value. Operators perform operations on operands (variables and constants). Common operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (**).
```
a = 10
b = 3
c = a + b  # Addition
d = a - b  # Subtraction
e = a * b  # Multiplication
f = a / b  # Division
g = a ** b  # Exponentiation

```
3. Functions  </br>
Functions in algebra map inputs to outputs. Similarly, in programming, functions encapsulate a block of code that performs a specific task. They can take inputs (arguments) and produce outputs. 
```
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

result = square(5)  # result will be 25

```
4. Equations and Inequalities </br>
It express relationships between variables. In programming, these are often used for conditional statements and loop conditions. 
```
# Equation
x = 10
y = 3
equation_result = x - y  # equation_result will be 7

# Inequality
if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")


```
5. Linear Algebra </br>
It deals with vectors, matrices, and their operations. These concepts are crucial in fields such as machine learning and graphics programming.
```
import numpy as np

# Vector addition
v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
v_sum = v1 + v2  # v_sum will be [5, 7, 9]

# Matrix multiplication
matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
matrix_product = np.dot(matrix1, matrix2)  # matrix_product will be [[19, 22], [43, 50]]

```
6. Boolean Algebra </br>
This deals with true (1) and false (0) values and logic operations such as AND, OR, and NOT. These concepts are essential for control flow and decision-making in programming. </br>
```
a = True
b = False

# Logical AND
result_and = a and b  # result_and will be False

# Logical OR
result_or = a or b  # result_or will be True

# Logical NOT
result_not = not a  # result_not will be False

```
