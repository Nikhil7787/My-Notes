#  Mathematics 

## ✅ Arithmetic

Arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. </br>
### Example:

```
a = 10
b = 5
addition_result = a + b  # 10 + 5 = 15
subtraction_result = a - b  # 10 - 5 = 5
multiplication_result = a * b  # 10 * 5 = 50
division_result = a / b  # 10 / 5 = 2.0
```


## ✅ Algebra
It forms the basis for solving problems, designing algorithms, and manipulating data structures. </br>
### Example: </br>
1. Variables </br>
variables are symbols (usually letters) that represent unknown or changing values. In programming, variables serve a similar purpose. They are used to store and manipulate data.
```
x = 5  # x is a variable storing the value 5
y = x + 3  # y is a variable storing the result of an operation involving x

```
2. Expressions and Operators </br>
Expressions are combinations of variables, constants, and operators that represent a value. Operators perform operations on operands (variables and constants). Common operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (**).
```
a = 10
b = 3
c = a + b  # Addition
d = a - b  # Subtraction
e = a * b  # Multiplication
f = a / b  # Division
g = a ** b  # Exponentiation

```
3. Functions  </br>
Functions in algebra map inputs to outputs. Similarly, in programming, functions encapsulate a block of code that performs a specific task. They can take inputs (arguments) and produce outputs. 
```
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

result = square(5)  # result will be 25

```
4. Equations and Inequalities </br>
It express relationships between variables. In programming, these are often used for conditional statements and loop conditions. 
```
# Equation
x = 10
y = 3
equation_result = x - y  # equation_result will be 7

# Inequality
if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")


```
5. Linear Algebra </br>
It deals with vectors, matrices, and their operations. These concepts are crucial in fields such as machine learning and graphics programming.
```
import numpy as np

# Vector addition
v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
v_sum = v1 + v2  # v_sum will be [5, 7, 9]

# Matrix multiplication
matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
matrix_product = np.dot(matrix1, matrix2)  # matrix_product will be [[19, 22], [43, 50]]

```
6. Boolean Algebra </br>
This deals with true (1) and false (0) values and logic operations such as AND, OR, and NOT. These concepts are essential for control flow and decision-making in programming. </br>
```
a = True
b = False

# Logical AND
result_and = a and b  # result_and will be False

# Logical OR
result_or = a or b  # result_or will be True

# Logical NOT
result_not = not a  # result_not will be False

```

### 10.  Perfect Numbers:

Definition: Natural numbers that are equal to the sum of their proper divisors (excluding the number itself). </br>
Examples: 6 (1 + 2 + 3 = 6), 28 (1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28).

</br>
</br>

### Divisibility:

Definition: A number is divisible by another number if the quotient is an integer, i.e., there is no remainder.</br>
Example: 12 is divisible by 3 because 12 ÷ 3 = 4 with no remainder. </br>
Applications: Checking divisibility is useful in algorithmic problems and optimizing code.


### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):

Definition: The greatest common divisor of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. </br>
Example: GCD(12, 18) = 6, GCD(15, 25) = 5. </br>

### Boolean Algebra:

Boolean algebra deals with operations on boolean values (true or false) and is fundamental to programming logic.
Boolean operators include AND, OR, and NOT.
Example:
```
x = True
y = False

# Logical AND
result_and = x and y  # result_and will be False

# Logical OR
result_or = x or y  # result_or will be True

# Logical NOT
result_not = not x  # result_not will be False
```

### Conditional Statements:

Conditional statements allow programs to make decisions based on conditions.
Common constructs include if statements, if-else statements, and switch statements (in languages that support them).
Example:
```
x = 5
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("x is negative")
else:
    print("x is zero")
```
### Logical Operators:

Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.
Common logical operators include AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).
Example:
```
age = 25
income = 60000

if age > 18 and income > 50000:
    print("You are eligible for a loan")
```
### Truth Tables:
Truth tables are used to represent the output of logical operations for all possible combinations of input values.
```
A   B   A AND B
----------------
T   T     T
T   F     F
F   T     F
F   F     F
```

### De Morgan's Laws:

De Morgan's Laws provide rules for negating logical expressions involving AND and OR.
Example:
```
# De Morgan's Laws
not (A and B) == (not A) or (not B)
not (A or B) == (not A) and (not B)
```
### Predicate Logic:

Predicate logic extends boolean logic to include variables and quantifiers (exists, for all).
Example:
```
# Predicate logic
# For all x, if x is greater than 0, then x squared is greater than 0
∀x : (x > 0) ⇒ (x^2 > 0)
```

### Logical Inference:

Logical inference involves drawing conclusions from known facts using logical rules.
Example:
```
# Given: If it's raining, then the ground is wet
# Conclusion: If the ground is wet, then it's raining (inverse)
```
